o	**Why are we doing this?**<br />
To prove or check that our skills meet SFIA Level 2 requirements.

o	**How I expected the challenge to go.**<br />
I expected it to be difficult as I was one week behind because I had to focus on other subjects to prepare for an exam for an interview (luckily I got the job).

o	**What went well? / What didn't go as planned?**<br />
Basically, I rewatched and followed along all the classes recorded and it's not too difficult if you follow Morgan's explanation.
In those terms, I fear having missed something out as I think the project is not going too bad, but I'm ashamed of having to ask now when it was probably explained already.
I will discover it on the scores.

o	**Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.**<br />
I will love to add a lot of more functionalities and entities, even create a formulary in html to interact with the API.

o	**Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.**<br />
